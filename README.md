# Owl-Population-Analysis
## Objective
This project aimed to focus on Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java development, specifically IntelliJ IDEA. This program  reads data from CSV files and performs calculations on it. This involved creating two main classes: Owl and OwlPopulation. The Owl class was designed to represent a single owl with properties like name, age, and weight. The OwlPopulation class was created to manage a collection of Owl objects, read them from a file, and perform various statistical analyses like finding the average age, the youngest owl, and the heaviest owl. Finally, we implemented a method to merge two owl populations while avoiding duplicates.

## Skills Learned
* Proficiency with IDEs: Gained experience in setting up and using a professional IDE like IntelliJ IDEA for Java development, including creating new projects, managing files, and running configurations.

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals: Strengthened understanding of creating classes, defining instance variables, writing constructors, and implementing methods like getters, setters, and equals().

* File I/O: Learned how to read and parse data from a file, specifically a comma-separated-value (CSV) file, using Java's File and Scanner classes.

* Data Structures: Practiced using and manipulating arrays of objects, in this case, an array of Owl objects.

* Algorithmic Thinking: Developed methods to calculate statistics on a dataset and merge two datasets, considering efficiency and avoiding duplicates.

## Tools Used
* IntelliJ IDEA: The primary IDE used for writing, compiling, and running the Java code.

* Terminal: Used for basic commands like git pull to update the project files.

* Text Editor: Used for viewing the raw content of the CSV files.
